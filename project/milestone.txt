CS193X Final Project Milestone
=============================

Project Name: Kit Switch Beta Website
Your Name: Samantha Liu
Your SUNetID: samanyl

Overview
--------
I honestly have not done much other than creating the home page and the subsequent pages. Some of CSS and HTML files are set up. Go to extra comments for my questions

Project Changes
---------------
Not going to make a floorplan layout tool configuration page
Site will be completely informative and illustrate why Kit Switch is needed today
This means, I am now interested in making interactive charts or including a map (need some guidance on what libraries to use, so far I've seen leaflet)

API
---
Mainly under the contact us page:
1. Ability to send emails to our team
2. Ability to upload and send their drawings/floorplan

External libraries and code
---------------------------
Looking into HTML canvas element and any other libraries

Collaboration and resources
---------------------------
The members of Kit Switch, and CS193X teaching staff

Anything else?
-------------
Currently wondering if there's a better way to break things up. Because I can continue with the way I'm going, but I feel it's a little inefficient and not very clean.
Have any other libraries/ideas that may help me out?
What is the best way to store the information/values/data for these eventual charts? using Mongo? using CSV? Google sheets?
