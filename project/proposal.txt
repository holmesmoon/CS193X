CS193X Final Project Proposal
=============================

Project Name: Kit Switch Beta Website
Your Name: Samantha Liu
Your SUNetID: 06020600

Description
-----------
I wish to create a functional user-interface website for a product that is currently called Kit-Switch, an interior design kit. On this website, you would be able to learn about the product, visualize different possible floorplan layouts, and contact the team.

Milestones
----------
1. Home page (logo, links to other parts of the website)
2. About Us page (the team, motivation, and contact infomration)
3. Floorplan Tool page (will be the toughest, but a client-server js script that allows users to add in lines to represent walls and room dividers)

External libraries and code
---------------------------
None (still need to explore what libraries are out there)

Collaboration and resources
---------------------------
The members of Kit Switch, and CS193X teaching staff 

Anything else?
-------------
If you have any suggestions or recommendations on which external libraries I would need/should look into, please let me know! (:
